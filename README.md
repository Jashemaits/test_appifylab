# test_appifylab

A new Flutter project with a focus on architecture and best practices.

## Project Architecture

This project follows a layered architecture approach, separating concerns into distinct layers for presentation, business logic, and data access. Flutter Bloc is used for state management, and dependency injection is handled by Get It. The project also leverages Retrofit for network requests and Shared Preferences for local storage. This architecture allows for a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase.
